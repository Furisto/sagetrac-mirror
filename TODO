*.Pcython files...

make might be faster when using := where appropriate

<package>-distcheck should run -check

FIXME: trap INT TERM EXIT during spkg-install (delete stage-stamp!)

FIXME: order-only dependencies on toolchain links

paths are suboptimal.
/build/pkgs should be /pkgs
/src should be pkgs/sagelib

dependencies must be where packages are, not in "deps"

CORE_MODULES should be built with with sagelib/spkg-install

unstage before fresh stage (when automatically staging?)

recheck: stage unstages before build has completed (good idea?)

decruft dependencies (sagelibspkg vs parts of it)

lapack, atlas. (argh). the lapack package does not install lapack. disabling atlas requires system lapack

complete old Makefile interface.

installation: can be implemented as follows:
- make DESTDIR work (e.g. through sage-dist-install)
- configure sage (the distribution) with a prefix, as usual
- build sage (will install with DESTDIR=@top_builddir@/.local
- @top_builddir@/local symlinks to .local/$prefix
- "make install" just installs everything

conditional silent rules does not work:
m4_ifdef([AM_SILENT_RULES],AM_SILENT_RULES([yes]))
does not set default to "silent",
AM_SILENT_RULES([yes])
does (?!)
