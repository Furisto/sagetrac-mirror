# Continuous Integration (CI)

We support [GitLab CI](https://gitlab.com) configured in
[gitlab-ci.yml](../.gitlab-ci.yml) through [docker](https://docker.com). This
directory contains bits which could be used by any CI implementation
presumably. The relevant docker files can be found in `/docker/`.
