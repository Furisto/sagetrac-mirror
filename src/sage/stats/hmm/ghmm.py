    ``[A * diagonal_matrix(c) for c in B.columns()]``.  However, this fails to take
    into account that the HMM emits its first output symbol before transitioning
    to a new state, while the GHMM transitions and emits together.  So, we add an
    extra 'startup' state to the GHMM, which outputs with the correct distribution
    and transitions appropriately to the regular states, which are as described
    above.

class GeneralizedHiddenMarkovModel:
    r'''
    A GeneralizedHiddenMarkovModel (GHMM) represents a Generalized
    Hidden Markov Model of the output-from-transition type. 
    If there are `n` states and `k` outputs, such a model is characterized by
    a list of `k` `n \times n` matricies `T_i` and an initial distribution
    (stochastic vector of length `k`).

    Each `T_i` is an `n \times n` matrix, where `T_i[j,k]` is the (pseudo)-probability of
    transitioning from state `j` to state `k` and emitting symbol `i`.

    The overall transition matrix `T` is the sum of the `T_i`.  Then `T[j,k]`
    is the pseudo-probability of transitioning from state `j` to state `k`.

    `T` must be stochastic; that is, every row should sum to 1.

    If the initial distribution is not provided, it is computed as the left
    eigenvector of `T` with eigenvalue 1.

    The `T_i` may have negative entries, which clearly cannot be interpreted as
    probabilities.  A GHMM is proper if for every output sequence, the calculated
    likelihood of this sequence (see :meth:`likelihood`) is nonnegative.
    In this case, we do indeed get a probability distribution over outputs 
    of any fixed length.

    EXAMPLES::

        sage: T0 = Matrix([[  0, 1/2],[1/2,   0]])
        sage: T1 = Matrix([[1/2,   0],[1/8, 3/8]])

    The "Golden Mean Process" (from [Upp1997]_).  This process always emits
    a 1 following a 0, and after a 1 emits 0 or 1 each with probability 1/2::

            - ``data`` -- Data defining the states and transition matricies of the GHMM.

        When the defining data is a list of transition matricies, the initial
        distribution can be omitted, in which case it will be the left egenvector
        for eigenvalue 1 for the transition matrix (i.e. sum of the listed matrices).

        If defining data is an instance of :class:GeneralizedHiddenMarkovModel,
        the transition matricies are copied. If ``initial_distribution`` is given
        then it is used, otherwise the initial distribution of the data is used.

        If the defining data is an instance of :class:hmm.DiscreteHiddenMarkovModel,
        an equivalent GHMM is determined.  This has 1 more state than the HMM, as may be
        needed in the general case (but the canonical form of this GHMM may have
        fewer states).  In this case, ``initial_distribution`` must be None and an
        initial distribution corresponding to the DiscreteHiddenMarkovModel's initial
        distribution is computed.

        outputs when traversing that edge.  ``D``'s states must be [0, 1, ..., k]
        for some ``k``.  The initial distribution can be omitted, in which case it
        will be computed as the left egenvector for eigenvalue 1 for the transition matrix.
        Otherwise, it should be a dictionary mapping vertices to pseudo-probabilities.

        Generate ``n_samples`` outputs from the process represented by ``self``.

        The outputs are yielded one by one.  If ``w = list(self.samples(n)``,

        EXAMPLES::

        We can collect statistics on the outputs. For ``G``, every odd output is 0
        and the rest are equally likely to be 0 or 1.  So if we sum up outputs of
        length 8, we should see sums of 0,1,2,3, or 4, with probility 1/16, 4/16,
        6/16, 4/16, and 1/16 respectively.  With 128 trials the expected number
        of occurrences of each sum is 8, 32, 48, 32, and 8, respectively.  The
        result we see below is typical, with a p-value of 0.74 for the
        chi-squared test.
