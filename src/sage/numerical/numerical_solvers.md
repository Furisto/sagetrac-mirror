# Things to do

## File renaming suggested by Jan
## Figure out how to return "solutions" to poly systems over QQ rings
## Make many of the polynomial_homotopy types' data attributes to private + add methods for access
## NumericalPoints should point to the systems that they solve
## WitnessSet -- isIrreducible method
## PointList with pretty printing
## I think some __repr__ functions in polynomial_homotopy probably need to be changed
## Get/maintain good coverage/pylint scores, make sure tess and build work
