# Things to do

## Sort out circular imports
## Get solvers + engine to the point where they can replicate examples in phcpy tutorial
## Make many of the polynomial_homotopy types' data attributes to private + add methods for access
## WitnessSet -- isIrreducible method
## I think some __repr__ functions in polynomial_homotopy probably need to be changed
## Get/maintain good coverage/pylint scores, make sure test and build work
## storing fibres that have been solved on parametrized polynomial systems
