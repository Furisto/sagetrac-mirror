Algebraic Tori
==============


Tori are implemented using the equivalence of categories with  character lattices
with an action of the Galois group (at least as large as the Galois group of
a splitting field). For now this Galois group will just be an abstract group,
either a permutation group or a finite matrix group in ``GL(n,ZZ)``.


To define a torus we use ``AlgebraicTorus(character_lattice)``

::

    sage: L = Lattice_ambient([], 1)
    sage: AlgebraicTorus(L)
    Algebraic Torus of rank 1 defined by the following lattice:
    Ambient free module of rank 1 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
    and an action by the Galois group of the form:
    Permutation Group with generators [()]

This is the split torus ``\mathbb{G}_m``, with action of the trivial Galois group.

::

    sage: LL = Lattice_ambient(SymmetricGroup(3), 1)
    sage: AlgebraicTorus(LL)
    Algebraic Torus of rank 1 defined by the following lattice:
    Ambient free module of rank 1 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
    and an action by the Galois group of the form:
    Symmetric group of order 3! as a permutation group

This is still ``\mathbb{G}_m``, with trivial action of a Galois group isomorphic to `S_3`. Note that
this Galois group is not necessarily the one of a minimal splitting extension.

::

    sage: act1 = matrix(3, [0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0])
    sage: act2 = matrix(3, [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1])
    sage: LLL = Lattice_ambient(SymmetricGroup(3), [act1, act2])
    sage: T3 = AlgebraicTorus(LLL); T3
    Algebraic Torus of rank 3 defined by the following lattice:
    Ambient free module of rank 3 over the principal ideal domain Integer Ring
    and an action by the Galois group of the form:
    Symmetric group of order 3! as a permutation group

This is a non-split anisotropic torus with Galois group of splitting field isomorphic to ``S_3``.

::

    sage: SL = SubLattice(L, [2*L.basis()[0]])
    sage: AlgebraicTorus(SL)
    Algebraic Torus of rank 1 defined by the following lattice:
    Free module of degree 1 and rank 1 over Integer Ring
    Echelon basis matrix:
    [2]
    and an action by the Galois group of the form:
    Permutation Group with generators [()]

This torus is obtained from the sublattice of the first lattice `L`. The torus obtained is isomorphic to `L`.

        We can recognize from class field theory that H^2 (the Brauer group of
        our extension) is isomorphic to the cyclic group Cn where n is the order of the
        Galois group. Here the group is S3, which has order 6 so we get C6.

        Another way to see it is seeing this H^2 as H^0 of its character lattice. Since the group
        acts trivially, the fixed elements are the whole lattice, and the trace map is multiplication
        by the order of the group, which is 6, so we get C6^(rank of T1)

        Also, ``H^0`` can be seen as the abelianization of the Galois group (indeed, by Tate-Nakayama it is
        ``H^2(\ZZ)``), which here has order 2 (it is the group of signatures)::

            sage: for i in range(-5, 6):

            H^3:  []
            H^4:  [2]

        In this example, we can see the 2-periodicity of the cohomology groups, consequence
        of the group being cyclic.

        - ``group`` -- the bigger group corresponding the the Galois group
        of the splitting field over the subfield one wishes to restrict scalars.

        .. NOTE::

            The user has to input the (larger) Galois group for this extension.
            More concretely, if the torus is defined over K, splits over L, and
            is defined by the action of Gal(L/K) on its character lattice, then
            if one wants the restriction of scalars to a smaller field k,
            one has to enter Gal(L/k) as argument of this method. This is because 
            galois groups of relative extensions are not supported so far. For 
            now the user has to input the Galois group of the relative extension
            as abstract group.
