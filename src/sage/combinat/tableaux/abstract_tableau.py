class AbstractTableau(Element):
    r"""
    Abstract class for the various element classes of tableaux.

    A tableau is thought of as a mapping which sends some pairs
    ``(x, y)`` (commonly, but not necessarily, pairs of nonnegative
    integers) to some arbitrary objects. Any two x-coordinates are
    assumed to be comparable via `>` and `<`, and so are any two
    y-coordinates.
    Subclasses are welcome to add further data (e.g., a skew shape).
    Tableaux are assumed to be immutable; see :trac:`15862`.

    The pairs ``(x, y)`` in the domain of a tableau are called its
    *cells*, and their images under the tableaux are referred to as
    its *entries* (in these cells).

    Subclasses must implement :meth:`_dict_unsafe`.
