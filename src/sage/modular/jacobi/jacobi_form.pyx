"""
This package provides a method of representing Jacobi forms and
computing Jacobi theta series. (See page 1 of [EZ1985]_ for a
definition of Jacobi theta series.)

EXAMPLES:

We can create the Jacobi-theta series for the `E_8` lattice with the
vector (0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0)::

    sage: ME8 = [[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\
                 [0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\
                 [0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\
                 [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1],\
                 [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1],\
                 [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\
                 [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0],\
                 [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2]]
    sage: QE8 = QuadraticForm(matrix(QQ,8,8,ME8))
    sage: Jacobi_Form(QE8,[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],4)
    Jacobi Form of weight 4 and index 1 with Fourier expansion:
    1 + (Z^-2 + 56*Z^-1 + 126 + 56*Z + Z^2)*q + (126*Z^-2 + 576*Z^-1 +
    756 + 576*Z + 126*Z^2)*q^2 + (56*Z^-3 + 756*Z^-2 + 1512*Z^-1 +
    2072 + 1512*Z + 756*Z^2 + 56*Z^3)*q^3 + (Z^-4 + 576*Z^-3 +
    2072*Z^-2 + 4032*Z^-1 + 4158 + 4032*Z + 2072*Z^2 + 576*Z^3 +
    Z^4)*q^4 + O(q^5)

Note that the Jacobi theta series for the zero vector recovers the
classical theta series::

    sage: D = DiagonalQuadraticForm(ZZ,[1,2,3,4])
    sage: Jacobi_Form(D,[0,0,0,0],9)
    Jacobi Form of weight 2 and index 0 with Fourier expansion:
    1 + 2*q + 2*q^2 + 6*q^3 + 8*q^4 + 8*q^5 + 16*q^6 + 16*q^7 + 14*q^8
    + 22*q^9 + O(q^10)
    sage: D.theta_series()
    1 + 2*q + 2*q^2 + 6*q^3 + 8*q^4 + 8*q^5 + 16*q^6 + 16*q^7 + 14*q^8
    + 22*q^9 + O(q^10)

ALGORITHMS:

Jacobi forms are created using the function
``compute_theta_series``. This algorithm is described in Section 5.2
of [deQ2010]_. It uses the method of Lagrange multipliers to find
the vectors x in the lattice for which the quadratic form
q(x) <= the precision which we want for the Fourier expansion.

..TODO::

    - Throw exceptions.
    - Change matrix in ``compute_theta_series`` to an integral matrix.
    - Consider other functions.
    - Add documentation for all the functions.
    - Copywrite statement.

        ALGORITHM:

        This algorithm is described in Section 5.2 of [deQ2010]_.  It
        involves iterating over all the vectors x in the lattice for
        which q(x)<= ``self._prec`` (the precision which we want for the
        Fourier expansion).  The vectors in the lattice which satisfy
        this property all lie within an n-dimensional ellipsoid,
        namely, q(x), where n is the dimension of the lattice.

        Notice if we intersect the ellipsoid defined by this equation
        with a hyperplane we obtain an (n-1)-dimensional ellipsoid. If
        intersect the resulting ellipsoid with another hyperplane we
        obtain an (n-2)-ellipsoid.  Repeating this process we
        eventually obtain a 0-dimensional point.

        If we iterate over all integral hyperplanes in one direction
        we get the (n-1)-ellipsoids that contain exactly those points
        (vectors x) such that q(x)<=._prec.  Following the recursive
        proceedure described in the last paragraph we can iterate over
        all of the integral points (vectors x) such that q(x)<=._prec.

        In order to perform this proceedure efficiently we will
        perform the following steps:

        #. Precomputations which allow us to effectively compute the
        changing position of the centre and boundaries of the
        ellipsoids as we interate through hyperplanes. The boundaries
        are computed using the method of Lagrange multipliers.

        #. Next we convert the python variables to C variables.

        #. As we iterate through the hyperplane, we iteratively
        compute the the values that change with each iteration (for
        example, the center and boundaries of the ellipse, and the
        values of the quadratic and bilinear forms restricted to the
        hyperplane). The computation is iterative in that it adjusts
        the value from the previous iteration rather the completely
        recomputing it.

        #. With each new hyperplane and resulting ellipsoid we recurse
        to the lower dimensions. We also iteratively compute the
        changing values.

        #. Finally we convert the number of vectors with each value of
        #q(x) and B(x,v) to coefficients for the Fourier expansion and
        #we return the object with the Fourier expansion.

        This function computes the Fourier coeffiecients of this Jacobi
        theta series.

        In order to do this we must iterate over all the lattice points
        such that q(x) <= _prec.

        General Description of Algorithm:
        We iterate over all points of the lattice such that
        q(x) <= _prec by observing that if we intersect the ellipse
        defined by this equation with a hyperplane we get a lower dimensional
        ellipse. Thus, if we iterate over all integral hyperplanes in one
        direction and follow a recursive proceedure we can iterate over all
        of the integral points.
        In order to perform this proceedure efficiently we will perform
        the following steps:

        1. Precomputations which allow us to effectively compute the
        changing position of the centre and boundaries of the ellipses.

        2. As we iterate through the hyperplane, we iteratively compute
        the the values that change with each iteration (for example the
        the center of the ellipse, the values of the quadratic and
        bilinear forms). The computation is iterative in that it adjusts
        the value from the previous iteration rather the completely
        recomputing it.

        3. As we recurse to the lower dimensions, we also iteratively
        compute the changing values.

        INPUT:

        2 or 3 objects in the following order:

        1. a positive-definite quadratic form with integral
           coefficients.

        2. an integral vector in the lattice associated to the
           quadratic form.

        3. (optional) the precision for the Jacobi form, that is,
           the highest power of q in the Fourier expansion.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: D = DiagonalQuadraticForm(ZZ,[1,1,1,1])
            sage: Jacobi_Form(D,[0,1,0,0],5)
            Jacobi Form of weight 2 and index 1 with Fourier expansion:
            1 + (Z^-2 + 6 + Z^2)*q + (6*Z^-2 + 12 + 6*Z^2)*q^2 + (12*Z^-2
            + 8 + 12*Z^2)*q^3 + (Z^-4 + 8*Z^-2 + 6 + 8*Z^2 + Z^4)*q^4 +
            (6*Z^-4 + 6*Z^-2 + 24 + 6*Z^2 + 6*Z^4)*q^5 + O(q^6)

        ALGORITHMS:

        Jacobi forms are created using the function
        compute_theta_series. This algorithm is described in Section
        5.2 of [deQ2010]_. It uses the method of Lagrange multipliers
        to find the vectors x in the lattice for which the quadratic
        form q(x)<=the precision which we want for the Fourier
        expansion.

           This function computes the Fourier coeffiecients of this Jacobi
              theta series.
           In order to do this we must iterate over all the lattice points
              such that q(x) <= _prec.

           General Description of Algorithm:
               We iterate over all points of the lattice such that
           q(x) <= _prec by observing that if we intersect the ellipse
           defined by this equation with a hyperplane we get a lower dimensional
           ellipse. Thus, if we iterate over all integral hyperplanes in one
           direction and follow a recursive proceedure we can iterate over all
           of the integral points.
               In order to perform this proceedure efficiently we will perform
           the following steps:
               1. Precomputations which allow us to effectively compute the
               changing position of the centre and boundaries of the ellipses.
               2. As we iterate through the hyperplane, we iteratively compute
               the the values that change with each iteration (for example the
               the center of the ellipse, the values of the quadratic and
               bilinear forms). The computation is iterative in that it adjusts
               the value from the previous iteration rather the completely
               recomputing it.
               3. As we recurse to the lower dimensions, we also iteratively
               compute the changing values.
