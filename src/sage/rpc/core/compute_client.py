"""
Client for the Sage Compute Service

The corresponding server implementation is at
:mod:`sage.rpc.compute_sever'. The client/server pair negotiate a
random string that can be used to mark the end of output, but the
:class:`ComputeClient` does not capture the server's output (and, in
particular, has no mechanism to check that this end marker appers in
the server stdout). See :mod:`sage.rpc.core.monitor.Monitor` for an
example that ties everything together.
