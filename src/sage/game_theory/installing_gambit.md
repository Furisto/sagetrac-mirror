At present Gambit is not an optional package (which is the first step to becoming a full part of Sage).
The good guys over at [Gambit]() have made some tweaks to their code to enable easier integration in to Sage: that all lives in this git branch: [https://github.com/tturocy/gambit/tree/sage_integration](https://github.com/tturocy/gambit/tree/sage_integration).

To install Gambit so that you can use NormalFormGame functionality, follow the steps below.
Make sure that you are using the most recent recent branch form this repository.

    git clone --single-branch --branch sage_integration https://github.com/tturocy/gambit
    cd gambit
    make dist

Alternatively, you can download the tar straight from [here](http://www.vincent-knight.com/static/gambit/gambit-14.0.2.tar.gz). Once the tar has been created/downloaded:

    mv gambit-14.0.2.tar.gz SAGE_ROOT/upstream
    cd SAGE_ROOT
    ./sage -i gambit

If the last command fails with `checksum` errors run `sage -sh sage-fix-pkg-checksums`.

The above steps should download the relative Gambit branch (you can of course simply add the corresponding remote branch to your own gambit repo if you have one), create a tarbell and then add it to sage.

To check that this is worked, in Sage simply type `import gambit`.
