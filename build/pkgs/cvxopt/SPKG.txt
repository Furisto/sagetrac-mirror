== Description ==

CVXOPT is a free software package for convex optimization based on the
Python programming language. It can be used with the interactive
Python interpreter, on the command line by executing Python scripts,
or integrated in other software via Python extension modules. Its main
purpose is to make the development of software for convex optimization
applications straightforward by building on Python's extensive
standard library and on the strengths of Python as a high-level
programming language.

== Dependencies ==

 * GNU patch
 * GSL
 * GLPK

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

 * TODO: Add more tests in spkg-check

 * TODO: one might want to enhance the code to allow other Sage
   random sources, at the moment only GSL is used in CVXOPT-1.1.3
   spkg, apparently it will need an unclear to me "with seed(..)"
   construct.
