== Dependencies ==

The following dependencies are not handled. As a result, not all
functionality of CGAL is available.

     - EIGEN (>=3.1)
       Required by the packages:
       o Estimation of Local Differential Properties of Point-Sampled Surfaces
       o Approximation of Ridges and Umbilics on Triangulated Surface Meshes
       o Planar Parameterization of Triangulated Surface Meshes
       o Surface Reconstruction from Point Sets
       http://eigen.tuxfamily.org

    - RS (root isolation)
       Required by the package:
       o Algebraic Kernel
       http://vegas.loria.fr/rs/
       Note: This is non-free software ("RS is freely distributable for non-commercial use")

     - ESBTL
       Optional to read PDB files:
       o Import data from a PDB file as CGAL points or weighted points.
         An example is given in package Skin_surface (see example skin_surface_pdb_reader.cpp)
       http://esbtl.sourceforge.net/

     - Qt5 (>= 5.3)
       http://qt-project.org/

     - libQGLViewer
       http://www.libqglviewer.com/

     - Geomview
       http://www.geomview.org/
       Not supported with Visual C++
