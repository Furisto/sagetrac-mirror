gappy: Python interface to GAP
==============================

Description
-----------

gappy provides a Python interface to the GAP computer algebra system by
linking to its library interface.

It allows calling functions in GAP directly from Python, and passing
supported Python objects back to GAP.

gappy is based on SageMath's LibGAP interface to GAP, originally developed
by Volker Braun, but is completely independent of Sage--it does not require
or use Sage at all, and can be used in any Python code. If there is enough
interest, it may also be enhanced with a complementary GAP package for
interacting with Python from within GAP.
