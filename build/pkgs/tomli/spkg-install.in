# Note that although flit_core has no build dependencies, it has one
# runtime dependency, Tomli. Tomli is itself packaged with Flit, so
# after building flit_core, you will need to use that to build Tomli,
# arranging for tomli to be importable directly from the source
# location (e.g. using the PYTHONPATH environment variable).

# flit_core actually imports toml not tomli?!?
