# Delete old (Shared)MeatAxe libraries. This ensures a sane state if
# installation of this package fails: the mtx library should exist if
# and only if meataxe is installed. In detail: the build-time check in
# src/module_list.py checks whether or not the "meataxe" package is
# marked as installed but the run-time check for the matrix_gfpn_dense
# module checks whether it can be imported. We need to ensure that these
# two conditions are equivalent, otherwise strange things can happen.
# See also https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24359#comment:154
#
# This also deletes the static library left behind from the installation
# of MeatAxe (as opposed to SharedMeatAxe).
