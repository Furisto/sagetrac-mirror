== Special Update/Build Instructions ==

- Call spkg-src from $SAGE_ROOT, to create a source ball that takes an
  upstream development version and adds a "make dist" target to include
  upstream's test suite.
- The package version is provided by the file <package-version.txt> and
  is of the form 2.5.0.<commit>.
- To upgreade to a different commit in the upstream repository for
  MeatAxe-2.5.0, just change <package-version.txt> accordingly, and
  spkg-src should do the right thing.
- To upgreade to a future 2.5.1 version, spkg-src needs to be modified.
