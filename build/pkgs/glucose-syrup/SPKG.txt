== Description ==

  Glucose is a SAT solver based on a particular scoring scheme for the clause
  learning mechanism, based on the paper Gilles Audemard and Laurent Simon
  wrote at IJCAI'09.  It is designed to be parallel, since 2014. The name of
  the Solver is a contraction of the concept of "glue clauses", a
  particular kind of clauses that glucose detects and preserves during search.

  Glucose is heavily based on Minisat, so please do cite Minisat also if you
  want to cite Glucose.
