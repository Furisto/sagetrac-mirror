== Description ==

MPIR is an open source multiprecision integer library derived from
version 5.0.1 of the GMP (GNU Multi Precision) project (which was
licensed LGPL v2+).

See http://www.mpir.org

 * LGPL V3+

== Upstream Contact ==
 * The Google group mpir-devel
 * thempirteam@googlemail.com

== Dependencies ==
 * iconv
 * GNU patch

== Special Update/Build Instructions ==
 * TODO:
   - Perhaps also modify CXXFLAGS (and/or CPPFLAGS).
   - We currently don't use anything of GMP's/MPIR's CC setting, and matching
     with the current compiler (`$CC`) is perhaps suboptimal.
 * Remove some files / directories not needed for Sage from upstream:
     rm -rf src/build.vc*             # Microsoft Visual C build files
     rm -rf src/yasm/Mkfiles/{dj,vc*} # DJGPP, Microsoft Visual C
   (Saves 13 of 40 MB uncompressed.)
 * 3.0.1prerelease is built from https://github.com/wbhart/mpir/pull/234
   by following the (outdated) procedure outlined in 
   https://github.com/wbhart/mpir/commit/1b3d5976292c6308c3f121c5ea2c406da0324bc8
   and then removing the unneeded stuff as outlined above.
