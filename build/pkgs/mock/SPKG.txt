= mock =

== Description ==

mock is a library for testing in Python. It allows you to replace parts of
your system under test with mock objects and make assertions about how they
have been used.

mock is now part of the Python standard library, available as unittest.mock in
Python 3.3 onwards.

This package contains a rolling backport of the standard library mock code
compatible with Python 2.6 and up, and 3.2 and up.

Please see the standard library documentation for more details.
