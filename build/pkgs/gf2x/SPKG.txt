== Special Update/Build Instructions ==
 * As sse2_tr_fixes.patch touches config/acinclude.m4, we have to touch
   aclocal.m4, configure, Makefile.in and gf2x/gf2x-config.h.in to prevent
   autotools to try to regenerate these files.

=== Patches ===
 * no-undefined.patch: pass -no-undefined flag to libtool.
 * hardware_specific_code.patch: backport upstream commits 162 and 167 to disable
   cpu-dependent optimizations.
 * sse2_tr_fixes.patch: backport upstream fixes for non-portable use of tr and for
   sse2 checks.
 * x86_64_sse2.patch: always support SSE2 on x86_64.
 * update_thresholds.patch: rename update-thresholds for Cygwin64.
