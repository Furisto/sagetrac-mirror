== Description ==

ThebeLab is a small JavaScript library built on top of JupyterLab that
makes the code cells embedded in a static HTML page editable and
executable. It's a more sustainable reimplementation of the Thebe
library that Sage was previously using.

This is used by Sage's Sphinx documentation build system to produce
html documentation that can be turned live. See:
- https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20690
- https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24593

Note: the part of the jupyterlab code base that thebelab uses is
automatically bundled in the thebelab tarball distributed by npm. So
this package does not depend on jupyterlab being installed separately.
